trying a programming language

Cool/Ugly features of Programming Language: 
  1. Multiple stacks to support continuation 
  2. Mini languages like: regex, brace expansion (generator reader syntax) 
  3. Support dynamic scoping (no closure :) needed) 
  4. Extreme easy to load C module 
  5. No garbage collection 
  6. First class streaming/pipeline, can borrow Feature from system tool 
  7. Syntax tree Macro to support DSL 
  8. Multiple core running, a easy way is to pipe to a C program
  9. First class testing

The closest language, which matches all above rules, turns out to be UNIX shell language, as always :) the one we use daily.
